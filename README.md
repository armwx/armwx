#### Background
I started my 'tech' journey as a Computer Science student where I learned AI and Development. I accidently stumbled upon 'UI/UX' during a hackathon. I like code but this felt different, so I went heads down into design.

As a design outsider, being technical actually helped me be a better designer and team mate. <wbr> I could be technical with devs and help them with frontend code from time to time. (Usually in form of providing code snippets)

> ‚ÄúWhen you‚Äôre a carpenter making a beautiful chest of drawers, you‚Äôre not going to use a piece of plywood on the back, even though it faces the wall and nobody will ever see it. You‚Äôll know it‚Äôs there, so you‚Äôre going to use a beautiful piece of wood on the back. For you to sleep well at night, the aesthetic, the quality, has to be carried all the way through.‚Äù
